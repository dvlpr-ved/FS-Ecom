            we are happy to offer free shipping to customers in pan India. However, if you
            are located in a special zone, you may be required to pay an extra shipping
            charge.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            We define special zones as areas that are outside of our normal shipping
            routes, or that require additional time or resources to deliver to. If you are
            unsure whether your location is considered a special zone, please contact us
            and we will be happy to provide more information.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            If you are located in a special zone, we may require you to pay an additional
            shipping charge in order to cover the extra costs associated with delivering
            to your area. We will always provide you with a clear explanation of any
            shipping charges before you complete your purchase, so you can make an
            informed decision about whether to proceed.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            Please note that our free shipping policy applies only to tier 1, 2, and 3
            cities. If you are located in a special zone and wish to take advantage of our
            free shipping offer, you may be required to meet a minimum order value or
            quantity. Again, we will always provide you with a clear explanation of any
            shipping charges or requirements before you complete your purchase.
