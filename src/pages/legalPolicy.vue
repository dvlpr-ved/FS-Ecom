            we are happy to offer free shipping to customers in pan India. However, if you
            are located in a special zone, you may be required to pay an extra shipping
            charge.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            We define special zones as areas that are outside of our normal shipping
            routes, or that require additional time or resources to deliver to. If you are
            unsure whether your location is considered a special zone, please contact us
            and we will be happy to provide more information.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            If you are located in a special zone, we may require you to pay an additional
            shipping charge in order to cover the extra costs associated with delivering
            to your area. We will always provide you with a clear explanation of any
            shipping charges before you complete your purchase, so you can make an
            informed decision about whether to proceed.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            Please note that our free shipping policy applies only to tier 1, 2, and 3
            cities. If you are located in a special zone and wish to take advantage of our
            free shipping offer, you may be required to meet a minimum order value or
            quantity. Again, we will always provide you with a clear explanation of any
            shipping charges or requirements before you complete your purchase.

          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            Regular resellers are those who have established a business relationship with
            our company and have a history of timely payments and reliable business
            practices. We trust all resellers/customers and believe that they deserve the
            convenience of COD as a payment option. But We take fraud prevention and
            financial security very seriously, and we work hard to ensure that all
            transactions are safe and secure, and we strive to provide payment options
            that are convenient and secure for everyone.
          </p>

            At Fashtsaly, we are committed to providing high-quality products and services
            to our customers. If you receive a product that is defective or wrong, we are
            happy to offer an exchange or return, provided you have a product opening
            video.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            To qualify for an exchange or return, you must have recorded a video of
            yourself opening the product when you received it. This video must clearly
            show any defects or issues with the product, or any discrepancies between the
            product you received and the product you ordered. If you discover a defect or
            wrong product later on, please contact us as soon as possible and provide us
            with the product opening video. We will review the video and determine whether
            you are eligible for an exchange or return.
          </p>
          <p class="lg:text-justify lg:text-[16px] mb-4">
            We understand that recording a product opening video may be an extra step, but
            it helps to protect both you and us in the event of any defects, issues or
            discrepancies with the product. We want you to be completely satisfied with
            your purchase, and we believe that this policy helps to ensure a fair and
            transparent exchange/return process.
